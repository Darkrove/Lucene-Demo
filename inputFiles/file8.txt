Next.js Conf exceeded all my expectations this year.

110,000+ registered and 55,000+ joined live to watch the keynote and community talks. Hundreds of developers joined live in San Francisco, London, and New York.

This conference was unlike any I've attended before – we put so much effort into creating a unique experience, both for those online and in person.

Building and growing a community is the most rewarding part of my role, and I'd like to take you behind the scenes on all things Next.js Conf 2022.

Dynamic at the speed of static.

In 1997, I gave a short talk at a Java conf about JS-first apps that stream UX, based on early JS adopters’ wild demos; but little did i know where the general idea would go thanks to many talented people over 25 years.

Better ingredients, better pizza, Next.js Conf
'Twas the night before Conf™️ and we hosted a small community dinner at a local pizzeria. It was invigorating. Old friends getting back together after years – and new friends joining from around the world to talk JavaScript and the Web.

One person told me:

"The food was good, the people were great, and the conversation was even better"

Honestly, it doesn't get much better than that for me.

We'll do it live¹
Our team sprinted towards the Conf finish line, trying to get everything ready for the big day. I told myself "Oh, we'll worry about the pre-show later, first we need to do [x, y, z]". Welp. Turn out preparing for things makes you more prepared.

It was kind of hilarious – Delba and I went to practice that morning and we both couldn't really make words come out of our mouths. A combination of nerves and excitement. I became stressed, 30 minutes before we were scheduled to go live in front of thousands of people.

But... the lack of scripting and planning actually led to a great outcome. We truly did it live – it felt authentic. To warm up the conference before the keynote, Delba and I bantered back and forth about the upcoming day of talks and brought community members and conf speakers up on the stage.

Thank you again Rich, Una, Dan, Swyx, and Kap for joining us. Y'all are the best.

Next.js 13 Pro Max by Vercel: Starting at $1299
After finishing the pre-show, Delba and I walked backstage to get mic'd up before the keynote Q&A. Guillermo was about to go out on stage. We wished him good luck, and off he went.

I watched the live monitor backstage and heard the crowd cheer. The gravity of the moment sunk in. I started jumping around with excitement. All the work had led to this moment.

There were so many tweets. I think my phone froze. And the memes – the memes were incredible.

The light-hearted jokes and slight roast of our very-clearly-Apple-inspired-love of the keynote made me smile and seemed fun for the whole community.

You can rewatch the keynote in case you missed it, or read my summary tweet thread.
